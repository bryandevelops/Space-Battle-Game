# Space Battle

#### Description
**Space Battle** is a simple space game played in the browser, where players are tasked with eliminating the threat of an incoming Alien Fleet. 

### Scenario
Earth has been attacked by a horde of aliens! You are the commander of the SSV Normandy SR-1, a Systems Alliance starship tasked with defending Earth by destroying every last alien ship.
Battle the aliens as you try to destroy them with your lasers.
There are six alien ships. The aliens' weakness is that they are too logical and attack one at a time: they will wait to see the outcome of a battle before deploying another alien ship. Your strength is that you have the initiative and get to attack first. However, you do not have targeting lasers and can only attack the aliens in order. After you have destroyed a ship, you have the option to make a hasty retreat.

## Rules
- The player attacks the alien ship first
- If the alien ship survives, the alien ship attacks the player
- If the player survives, the player attacks the alien ship again
- This game loop continues until you destroy the alien ship
- Afterwards, you have the option to `Attack` the next ship or to `Retreat`
- If you `Retreat`, the game is over but your ship survives
- If you `Attack`, the game loop begins again against the next alien ship
- You win the game if you destroy all of the alien ships
- You lose the game if your ship is destroyed
